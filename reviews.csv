19018,Careful Buyer,5,288,Overall Good Laptop for both medium-high graphic quality gaming and work/anything else,India,21-May-22,Verified Purchase,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background software keeps cpu working at 30-40% even at idle. But right when you launch task manager to see which process is taking up so much CPU resources, these processes stop right away and you can't even figure out what processes were running. Suddenly the processor load is at 1 or 2% instead of 30-40%. Something is going on with Windows11. My issue was this background shenanigans kept the CPU/Laptop hot. Even at 30% CPU load, temperature can get near 100C. So what I do now is always keep task manager running, this keeps the unnecessary background processes stopped and lets my CPU be cool when idle. To monitor CPU load and also temperature a software called CoreTemp can be used. Essential if your CPU is being used/hijacked by some unnecessary process which hides itself in the Windows Task manager like in my case.edit: Used a third party software called Anvir taskmanager  and found windows explorer was keeping the cpu at 33% load even when idle, making the CPU temperature reach 100C for no reason. So just restarting the explorer in taskmanager fixed the issue.Initially without any clue as to what was happening, I had to re-paste the CPU/GPU thermal paste, try out a third-party software to control AMD Ryzen temperature. More about that below. Also figured out HP factory setup for the laptop back panel had a plastic sheet which was covering up a huge air vent. So make sure to discard plastic sheet if you are planning to game and want to keep the laptop  as cool as possible.I like my laptop to stay sort of cool even when gaming, so it lasts long and I don't have to worry about replacing it's fan sooner. I re-pasted the CPU and GPU with some Cooler Master MasterGel Pro Thermal Paste. When I opened up the thermal heat sink metal plate, there were two kinds of paste, grey on CPU/GPU and white on some other chips. The white paste is a silicon based paste called CLG-3500 the name you can find in the Maintenance and Service guide for this laptop on HP website. I left the white paste there, it's of lower thermal conductivity so basically lower quality than mastergel. I filled some gaps on it with my higher thermal conducting Mastergel paste, a few drops here and there. These chips are of lower importance in generating heat when compared to CPU/GPU and also Mastergel paste does not conduct electricity.  For CPU GPU I cleaned out entire factory applied grey thermal paste with some iso alcohol/cloth and then repasted with my Mastergel paste. The mastergel/thermal paste only conducts heat to metal plate and it's upto the fans/ventilation to remove it from metal plates.HP factory setting for this  laptop blocks the main air vent on the back panel of the laptop with some kind of plastic/paper sheet thing. You can see attached pics. Don't know why HP would block a huge air vent they made themselves for their gaming laptop with a plastic sheet. This air vent sits right on top of the heat conducting metal plate and so opening this up would conduct away most of the heat from the metal plate easily, letting the laptop run cooler more easily and letting the laptop fan do less work and thus last longer. Any plans to use a laptop cooler stand with built in fans would be more effective if the back panel had lots of holes on it for cooler air to flow in. An MSi bravo laptop that I considered with same processor and graphics card  as this HP victus has a backpanel that exposes most of it's metal plates to air easily with lots of holes. I initially thought this HP model also had air vents from the few pics could find earlier but only found it was blocked once I got it in my hand. So I plucked out this blocking sheet right out of the backpanel and now my airvents are fully open exposing the hot metal plate. I made a DIY laptop stand with a USB table fan and an inverted plastic box with a big hole for the fan to sit in. I put the fan inside the box and the laptop on top of the box so that the fan blows air right at the air vent/metal heat sink plate.With this set up I am able to keep my laptop cool when gaming heavy. I ran God of War game at high graphic settings, which made my CPU consume 80-90Watts and GPU 70-80 watts and produce maximum heat, CPU went to 101 C and GPU to 90C. The frames per second for GOW game was good at 40-65fps in closed settings and slightly laggy in rare occassions. But since I repasted the CPU/GPU, my laptop backpanel air vent was fully open and I also put a table fan blowing air into the metal heat sink ... over all the laptop body was cool underside and slightly warm to touch on keyboard regardless of whether the CPU/GPU was hot. Also monitored the laptop CPU fan speed using Speedfan 4.52 software. The maximum speed is around 4800 rpm (OMEN software can force CPU fan to maximum speed). while idle it's around 2200 rpm without external fan and 0 rpm with external fan. While gaming with my current set up and an external fan, the cpu fan speed is around 3800 to 4000 rpm. It never reaches the maximum speed because over all laptop is cool even when CPU is hot.For experts who know about TDP and want to control CPU wattage and temperature directly, there are two softwares, one is Ryzen controller and other is AMD APU Tuning Utility. Both use another program called RyzenAdj.exe which can directly change certain parameters of the Ryzen CPUs. For this Ryzen 5600H cpu, the max TDP power value it can operate at is around 113 Watts. The max temperature it can operate at is around 100C. Both are factory set and can be found using command line interface with Ryzenadj software. So using one of these softwares Ryzenadj, Ryzen controller  or AMD APU Tuning Utility, you can set these values during a user session. For example you can decrease  the maximum wattage allowed from 113 to 50 watts and maximum temperature can be decreased from 100C to say 70C. With these new values, the Ryzen 5600h CPU will not be able to use more power or will not be allowed to heat up beyond the set value. These settings are always reset upon restart of the laptop provided you do not apply it again.  So I  used these softwares to try to decrease my laptop  temperature. For idle/not gaming setting, I would use a temperature limit of 70C and the CPU would never cross this value. You can also use these softwares to set temperature or TDP wattage values while gaming. For example a setting I used was not allow temperature to cross above 80C  and not allow TDP to cross above 75W. Only one of these values will take precedence over the other, probably the temperature one because CPU heats up really fast even with 30% load. Played a lot using these settings and was able to get good 40-60 fps in Racing game Dirt 5 in high medium mix graphic settings on a heavy rain race track simulating most weather and graphic effects. The CPU temperature never crossed 80-81C. GPu temperature reached near 80C but this cannot be controlled directly by these softwares, only can change and control CPU values. If lacking a Laptop cooling stand and external fan, I would use these softwares to decrease laptop temperature but otherwise it's not necessary.Laptop monitor lacks color, Recommend installing latest AMD radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin software. I increased the saturation of my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software also has a vivid setting for global display/graphics. Use that to show more colorful display and in game .The Laptop graphics card has 4GB vram which can affect high texture graphics required for some games. Some games like dirt 5 or forza 5 gives vram low warnings. Still for Dirt 5 graphics is pretty great. For Forza 5 it could use a bit improvement. Forza 4 runs great and has great graphics though. Though at this price point this laptop is good , most 6GB vram laptops are selling  at way higher prices. I would recommend a high 6GB VRAM graphic card rather than a Nvidia 3050 as an improvement over this rx 5500mAlso recommend getting another 8GB RAM as it would add more to gaming and multi tasking experience.  I installed two 16 Gb rams to have total 32GB and everything works great, switches programs on the fly, from gaming to work instantly. Some rare games like God of war and Modern warfare warzone battle royale used more than 16 GB ram, up to 20GB. For most other games 16GB should be more than enough.edit: tried out several games, all action adventure and racing games available for  xbox gaming pass and EA play subscription . Over all the impression is this laptop is good for gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution with greater than 40 fps minimum at high graphic settings. It can go to ultra graphics for games released before 2020. One issue I found was when gaming long hours, the battery seems to be discharging at a slow but significant rate even when power cable was connected. The issue could be either laptop or my home's power lines. No idea.edit2:Due to modifying my laptop cpu's power settings using third party sw, or due to unlocking and using windows ultimate performance/high performance power plans in windows power options, one of those two reasons, Maybe not these reasons at all, but anyway my cpu and gpu together are consuming more than 150 watts  that the power brick can provide and this is what is causing the battery drainage when I play games for over 5 to 6 hours continuously. So I now limit the cpu power limit to around 78W using ryzen controller sw. Rest of the power from power brick is reserved for graphics card. This resolves the battery draining problem I was having and I am still able to play games at more or less same quality, speed and graphics. Constant draining and recharging would be bad for battery life. This makes it seem like the cpu and gpu of this laptop could have performed greater if it were provided a 200W power brick."
18624,Dhruv Srivastava,5,10,Budget king - period,India,22-Jan-23,Verified Purchase,"Review post approx. 5 months of use:Despite the disappointing state of Indian laptop market since mid-2020s, I'd go ahead and say that if you're looking for a laptop for budget gaming or media creation, at the time of writing this review - this is the best you can do in terms of price to performance ratio. This is currently the best performance laptop you can buy in 50k-85k segment. And that's a huge claim, I know, but the Indian laptop market is that screwed at the moment. There are just no fair offerings in that segment and that segment is supposed to be multiple segments (like 50-60k, 60-70k, 70-80k and so on). Of course I'm leaving out RTX3050 laptops but I don't think they're priced well for what they're offering. The only other laptops that make sense would be 3050Ti ones due to their higher performance and even then, their pricetags are not proportional to the increase in performance when compared to this RX5500M laptop. You pay way more than the performance bump you get.Also, please remember to uninstall bloatware and stick to OEM graphics drivers instead of installing Radeon graphics drivers (because every laptop is different and parent companies know better about what drivers would serve their laptops better- speaking from experience with this very laptop).The Victus has a lot of things going for it. Remember, I bought this was like 48k in a sale so the features it has at that price point are a no-brainer.Pros:- Tiny bezel around the screen makes it feel so slick and modern- Screen size is plenty big and the screen quality is quite pleasant to look at- Backlit keyboard (white light only but that's not something I consider a con since I don't like RGB anyways)- Numpad included in the keyboard- Awesome thermals. It plays games like CSGO and Mudrunner on max settings without having to ramp up the fans so the experience is quiet and pleasant. Although, playing more demanding games like Snowrunner do tend to make it run hot so the fans spool up to higher RPMs (in which case you can just use noise-cancelling headphones to offset that issue).- Best in class CPU and graphics card. I added in another 8GB RAM stick and this thing is now unstoppable!-Soild build quality. I was attacked by a dog so hard that I got knocked back while this laptop was in my bag behind my back and when I fell, the bag was crushed under my weight. Not a scratch.- Minimalist design is very much appreciated. I hate loud, flashy, obnoxious designs from other brands screaming, ""LOOK AT MEEE!!!1!1!!"" so this subtle, subdued but still upmarket design is great for me.- People complain about this laptop's screen wobbling issue, especially while under a running fan. Sure, it's a thin screen so it's bound to happen but honestly, I don't see it. Yeah, it does wobble if you slap the screen gently but that's rare and also, why would you? I just leave the screen alone and do my thing. Haven't had a problem yet.Cons:- It's very heavy. At 2.5 kg, this thing is a behemoth. But I guess, you can't have everything. I'm okay with this being the only con to that many features at this price point.- Can't think of any other cons. In fact, I haven't had any other issues with it during the last 5 months of my ownership at all whatsoever so... that's great!Honestly, this is a great value for money laptop and I recently recommend it and got at least 3 other people to buy it. Not one of them has had an issue either. This laptop was one of the best strategies adopted by HP of late. I look forward to many years of worry-free gaming and 3D animation with this thing."

18455,Likhith,4,14,Good performance with AMD Advantage Edition.,India,02-Dec-22,Verified Purchase,"Overall performance can be rated 4.5 out of 5. The IPS FHD display with HDR is good and it plays 4K resolution HDR videos with no tearing but could have been better if a 144Hz refresh rate is available(if you’re looking for gaming purpose then go for MSI Bravo 15 which comes with same configuration but with a 144Hz AMD Freesync compatible display). Built in speakers do a remarkable job and there is Bang and Olufsen app for modification of audio levels. Coming to the GPU part, as long as you have AMD stable drivers, the performance is fantastic but dont expect ReLive to work because there is Radeon integrated GPU along with Ryzen 5 5600 enabled but you can make BIOS changes to 'GPU-Discrete only' and switch the GPU to RX5500M alone to make it work. And speaking of BIOS, there will be an update available but it just won't install and the HP support team will try their best but it can't be resolved. That is the only issue I've faced so far, just the BIOS won't install but it doesn't affect performance for basic and regular users and gamers. Also the USB ports on the left will work even if the device is shut down, so this can be useful if you're travelling where the laptop is in  your backpack and you can plug in your phone as use it as a power source since the laptop has a 70 watt hour battery. Speaking of battery back up, using it for basic usage in balanced mode with battery saver turned on, it lasts around 7 hours but with the high performance mode turned on and usage for graphic works, it lasts for around 3 hours. Coming to the connectivity and ease of usage, everything works just fine. The backlight keyboard has toggle on and off but there are no brightness levels to change.  This can be most suitable for people who use for both education related as well as multimedia and also for mediumto high graphic gaming."

 Screen is below average when I used it first time . Then I used and driver (adrenaline version and select vivid gaming mode + slightly increased saturation). Now screen looks fine. Performance is good , built quality is ok, speakers above average, battery normally last for 5 hours ( may vary on your usage like 7-8 hour or more on battery saver mode in movies or chrome , 3 hour while gamming.

17433,Mayank Shrivas,5,5,"For 55K , this is some really good hardware.",India,13-Jan-23,Verified Purchase,"Basically what HP has done is given you a slightly weaker OMEN but fixed all flaws of the OMEN.First of all , to kick all myths out of the way:1. Yes , the screen wobbles a bit. But it's not at all a big deal. The hinges are very sturdy and I did not face any issue typing on it.2. The laptop has excellent cooling , even in the base model. I played some heavy games for an hour ,and CPU and GPU temps never crossed 60. The fan has a very gentle but long fan curve and if you crank it up to max , you will feel like it's a jet engine. But leave it at auto , and you will barely even notice it. HP has done an excellent job with the cooling.Coming to the build quality , HP has done an outstanding job in terms of looks and finish. Even if you look at competing laptops in this price range , they stand nowhere near to how good this laptop looks. I can't stress it enough that how immaculate those V designs look in real life and how they have done an outstanding job with matte finish. One of the best matte finishings I have seen. In terms of aesthetics , THIS LAPTOP IS A VIBE.You can clearly see that HP spent actual efforts towards the design and aesthetics. They went even as far as to color the inside of the USB 3 ports black . They could have left it blue by default if they wanted to and no one would complain.Port selection is amazing and you get three USB 3 ports , all supporting 5 GBPs transfers. Every other laptop in this price segment would give you two USB 2 ports and 1 USB 3 port. Type C port is also of 3.2 type.HP have really outdone themselves with this machine. They have clearly focused on perfecting tiny details like giving Bluetooth 5.2 support instead of only 5.0 (very nice!) , super easy upgradability and a complete package rather than screaming gamer vibes like they do with some pavilion laptops. This is easily the king of gaming laptops in 50-55k range. It's listed MRP on box is 76K."

18987,Kindle Customer,5,One,Six month review.,India,17-Jan-23,Verified Purchase,"Its a decent laptop,not a powerhouse, but will get you through most things without hassle. I dont use it for gaming mostly just coding. If u r a machine learning aspirant you should know CUDA doesnt work as its radeon graphics.  Its a very dependable laptop if you are not using it for gaming with good battery backup. Video editing and rendering might be a bit too much for this laptop but I tried it only once and things got really slow. For my purposes its a champion and for each it might differ based on their needs"
17339,Kumar,5,5,Excellent but!,India,18-Dec-22,Verified Purchase,"Pros:I am amazed with the performance of the Ryzen 5. Glad that I purchased this laptop for the programming and video editing.Fast Storage transfers.Better user experinece.Very nice keyboard.Sufficient Graphics Card.Cons:The design is a bit mediocre.The display panel shakes when I sit below the fan running in full speed. This ruins any meetings that has video camera turned on.Even after I shutdown the laptop with 100% batter charged, the USB and type c ports dissipate power to connected devices, such as laptop cooler, type c dock extension that connects HDMI to TV. So when I see the laptop cooler it still runs the fan after the laptop is shut down. When I turn on the laptop after a day or so, it doesn't turns on. So I have to plug in power source and only then laptop turns on and I find the batter down to 0%. This is not a battery problem, but the poor design with USB ports, and Type c port. This is really daunting and I hope HP will fix this through some software drivers as patches.Review for Amazon:Though I purchased this laptop for Zero Cost EMI, where amazon has mentioned No Cost EMI Discount worth Rs.2,807.76/-, the HSBC has charged me this amount as Net Outsanding Balance along with GST. Escalating this to Amazon didn't help as they mentioned that they need to reach HSBC for this.When I reached HSBC, they mentioned Amazon has not mentioned a clause to charge this amount for converting the purchase to EMIs.So please be careful when opting for No Cost EMIs eventhough you see ""No Cost EMI Discount"" from Amazon, the Credit Card Company actually charges the amount to you. And Amazon should have taken care of this clause when defining such discounts with the Credit Card companies."

16970,Shubham Patil,4,26,"Good for Gaming, Wrong config for Video Editing/Creators. Terrible WiFi issue",India,16-Sep-22,Verified Purchase,"Bought this in December 2021, when I was on a lookout for a new laptop to edit videos on. I chose a gaming laptop since the hardware suitable for such task is only available on gaming machines in this category and budget. I had done my research which told me that video rendering is mostly a CPU-heavy task and there was very little difference between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. It was my mistake to believe it. Premiere Pro doesn't officially support AMD Radeon 5500M, though its latest version does support hardware encoding with AMD GPU, but I still feel a lack of performance. If you want to further your interests with After Effects and Blender, then it is totally not an ideal GPU currently. Better to go with similarly specced NVIDIA model.Other big pet peeve is that the Realtek WiFi card stops working once in a while, needing to restart the computer or disable and reenable the card from Windows Device Manager. Very frustrating, especially if you're in middle of a call or a transaction. I don't know if it's a driver or hardware issue. I waited for a software update all this time, but will go to the service center and get the card replaced now. Even the GPU drivers from HP are mismatch and Radeon Software was not behaving properly with the stock drivers.Despite the configuration, the weight is a bit too much, makes it a pain to carry around. And the 16 inch screen size didn't feel like a big increment from 15.6 perhaps because of the aspect ratio.No complaints on gaming front, everything runs smoothly, the GPU gets to do its work pretty well there. The battery drains quickly under medium to heavy loads though."

Rx5500m is a really good GPU! :)Edit: after 3 months the screen bleeding issue turned out to be a faulty screen and the backlight stopped working, in Bangalore there is just ONE official service centre and i had to get the screen replaced, took 10 days for them to change it.I would suggest buyers not compromise on even the smallest faults, get your product replaced immediately because later it might become ab issue, like it did for me"

19190,Apurva Patel,5,7,A perfect tool for casual gamers.,India,20-Aug-22,Verified Purchase,"Since it's an entry-level gaming laptop, that said it's understandable that it's bulky and the screen refresh rate is 60hz which you are going to see in lots of reviews. Btw I am posting this review after using this laptop for 3 months now.So first let's talk about some of the graphic intensive games and their fps: - in all games, I have locked fps to 60hz so it might be higher for some games.1. The Witcher 3 (ultra) : 60fps2. Destiny2 (high): 60fps3. The Division 2 (ultra) :  51-59 fps4. The Crew 2 (high) : 45 fps avg.5. RDR 2 (high - this is the highest setting i can apply because of limited vRAM) :  40 - 45 fpsthe only thing which I don't like is that the bottom heat sink is not quite raised, so if I don't raise the laptop a little bit from the back the temp touched 100 degrees even though the fans are running at max speed.I also faced an issue installing the AMD software: adrenalin edition which its equivalent to Geforce experience, so I cannot do the fine-tuning or optimizing to some of the games which are built for AMD graphics.All other features are absolute above par compared to the price -1. Battery ( i think this would be the usp for this laptop),2. Speakers are great depending on what you are listening (it's loud for the music but for gaming and streaming movies it's not that great ).3. Not RGB backlit keyboard - which I really want no RGB BS.4. You can expect 6 core cpu (3.10 ghz boost) in this price segment in the gaming laptop - all thanks to AMD5. Radeon Rx 5500M which beats the gtx 1650 and 1650ti at the lower price.All in all, there are few cons that come with this laptop which are not worth mentioning because this is a budget laptop, and to reduce the cost they have to definitely compromise in some ways. So as compared to other gaming laptops in this price segment this would definitely beat the others.For me, this laptop is meeting my day-to-day requirements as of now."
18954,Amazon Customer,3,One,Great product but warranty issue,India,15-Jan-23,Verified Purchase,Great computer for my use. Good for editing videos and my daily office work. Fast booting. Only problem is screen wobble while opening it. Else a good laptop. Wish I had ordered it 3 to 4 hours later as the price went down with offer. A good price difference which I missed. I could have upgraded the ram to 16gb with that amount. 😢 Warranty starts in Sep 22 for a product I purchased in Jan 23

 I bought this laptop for ₹62,000, (although the price dips at times to ₹58,990). It is one of the best laptops in this price segment considering both it's performance and functionality.Pros:1. It has the Radeon 5500m graphics card, which is better than the GTX 1650, that you will find in other similar, lower and even some higher priced laptops. The 5500m can easily run all recent titles at medium to high settings, 1080p 60fps. In older games like battlefield 1, GTA 5, Metro Redux, etc you can crank the settings to ultra and the fps will remain at 60fps.2. The Ryzen 5 5600H is a beast of a processor and can handle anything that you can throw at it.3. The 70 watt hour battery (compared to the 50 watt hour that you will find in other laptops) easily gives around 6hrs of normal use e.g. browsing, youtube, video playback, a bit of photoshop etc. while the other laptops in the price segment can hardly manage 4hrs.4. The build quality is amazing. Its made for people, like students who need a daily driver laptop which can game and at the same time does not look too flashy. Its functional, the keyboard is good, mousepad feels good to use and the overall build quality is great.5. Viewing angles are great, no glare or reflections as it is a matt finish screen.Cons:1. The fan intake vents are on either sides of the laptop. So if you are using the laptop, keeping it on your lap, the fan intakes will get blocked. You will have to keep a hard, flat base underneath in order to prevent the intakes from getting blocked.2. The laptop is a bit heavy and if you are thinking of keeping it on your lap and using it, good luck. Your legs are going to go numb in a very short time.3. The screen does not get very bright. So it will be difficult to use it outside, under direct sunlight.*Note:In many online reviews you will find complains about screen wobbling, but the issue is not as much as they are making it to be. The screen has a normal amount of wobble which you will find in most other similar sized laptops.And if you are looking for a laptop for gaming only, don't buy this. Rather go for something with a 3050. This is good for casual gaming (it can run all games but you'll have to compromise on the graphics a bit) but not for playing all games at maxed settings and streaming at the same time.I've run the following games on this laptop and all of them work great:Days GoneNFS HeatGTA 5Battlefield 1Metro ReduxDishonored 1 & 2"

17009,JB,3,2,Build quality is not great,India,15-Dec-22,Verified Purchase,"No issues with performance. It's quite fast.Boots up in a few seconds. I've also dual booted it with Ubuntu 20, and driver support is good right out of the box.ButThe touchpad button is falsely triggered now and then if you use it on your lap instead of a flat sturdy table. This is because the plastic body flexes a little which easily triggers the button. The touchpad is also a little too large and can interfere while typing. My palm touches it often while typing, resulting in a lot of undo moves.The bottom right corner backlight LED of the screen stopped working. So I have a dark corner in the screen"

They arranged inspection twice but no one came for inspection and they marked as inspection completed. I contacted with amazon customer care, they registered compliant against them and processed my replacement. After a painfull process they finally replaced it. They were very polite.Screen wobbling vary from laptop to laptop. The previous one i got had tight hinges and didn't wobble at all. But the one I have now have wobbling issue If i sit under fan.It wobble only under fan or cooler.I use it in power saving mode with 0 brightness with 7-8 tabs open in browser, vs code, android studio.It gives me 6 to 8 hours battery backup. And when i only watch videos it gives me 9 hours backup.I haven't tried gaming on it so cant say about that.If you want good battery backup then always use it in battery saver mode."

20382,Amazon Customer,4,7,Above average laptop within 60k range,India,24-May-22,Verified Purchase,"Gaming - 10/10,  fps in most latest welldemanding games is well above 50 range. Thermals- 5/10, in ambient room temp of 35-40+ range the thermals are below average only while playing games like red dead redemption 2. The gpu temp touches 85+ degrees c.  But if you have AC room that is not a problem. In the long run the gpu life is affected a lot by high temps. So better thermals would have been appreciated here. But whilst idle, the thermals are good enough. Roughly in the range of 50-60degrees c. Fan mode doesnot help much if your ambient temps are high. Rx 5500m is very close to rtx 3050 without dlss of nvidia. Ofcourse after dlss rtx wins easily in supported games.Battery- 10/10, easily getting 8-10hours of backup surfing web and watching videos..and Charging is very fast.Display - 7/10, just above average and what you expect from this range gaming laptops. 60 hertz is just okay. Not extremely enjoyeable multimedia experience.Sound speakers- 6/10, average again, with vlc you can increase to 200% volume  but it can damage the speakers in long run. Earphone sound is great.Camera-5/10 , just average class.Overall performance- 9/10, great performance  in totality. And best to get it on sales when it goes as low as 55k range.Overall can't go wrong with this in the 55k range."
17049,JvD,3,2,OK-OK Laptop,India,13-Nov-22,Verified Purchase,"I was initially happy to get this. I did upgrade the RAM to 16 GB because 8 GB was too slow for me.Even after upgrade of RAM, I feel the laptop lags at times and I think it is because of Windows 11 which is crap in my opinion.  Overall an okish laptop for the price.Pros are Windows 11 licensed edition along with Microsoft Office lifetime license. Processor is decent enough. Price was decent got at 50k package. Gets windows update frequently.Cons are Battery life is so bad at times gives 1.30 hrs for processor-intensive tasks and 4 hours plus for normal web browsing.  Wifi keeps getting disconnected at times, not sure if this is an issue with Windows 11 or the hardware but disabling driver and enabling fixes the issue, so looks like a driver issue somehow.Screen wobbles if you are carrying that is not a big issue as long as you are not running with it the screen open."

 I have been using this laptop for 4 day's had great experience while using it after a complete windows setup and driver's update, but for the driver's update for amd ""CPU+GPU"" driver's pls use AMD-Adrenalin software so that the graphics driver's are upto date and by this your experience will be lagg free for normal and especially for gaming and the battery life is to significantly improved .This type of Performance is top-notch for the price to performance ratio in this laptop .No heating issues at all while gaming ""Game name-Genshin impact"" at high settings the temperature went upto 83 degree Celsius with fan speed at Max and cooled down soon as the game is closed. The room temperature was 27-28 degree Celsius and still had great thermal efficiency nice work HP-VICTUS. The game was played on charging for 2hrs  continuously.People were talking about screen wobbling issue yes it has screen wobbling  but it's not an issue actually due to bigger screen it wobbels but yes HP-VICTUS Engineer should look after it but the hinges are good, That's why if the screen wobbled with the movement of hinges then it would be a problem but the hinges are tight just the screen itself wobbles so no need to worry about this screen wobbling ✌️.Keyboard and trackpad are good and responsive so good for it and fast boot speed ,The only thing is the camera quality it's poor it's ok not an great issue but it's competitors has good one so that's the only con of it.So the final conclusion for this laptop is great you can go for it without any hesitation ✌️💯And it comes with the free x-box game pass and Microsoft office lifetime validity for free ."

18984,Amazon Customer,3,,Only a glimpse of gaming laptop.,India,25-Oct-22,Verified Purchase,The good: -(1) looks good and has a good ventilation.(2) performance is very snappy.(3) good battery life for very basic use like Microsoft excel. It lasts 6-7 hrs on it.(4) charges fast.(5) keyboard algorithm is very good and the toughpad is big and very useful.The bad and the ugly:(1) 100% of battery will only last 20-30mins max on gaming. And so you have to keep it plugged.(2) power on the laptop and launch the game immediately and the game will lag/stutter for 10mins. Idk why... Even i upgraded the ram to 16gb.(3) built quality is descent but the plastic edges may hurt yo sometimes.(4) screen wobble may annoy you.(5) screen bleed is ugly.(6) sound quality is good but B&O but the volume is very low.. Bottom firing speakers with pure treble. Not even a trace of beats in the sound signature... Not idk for what reason the audio output from aux is very poor.. Mono like sound... With no bass!.(7) will not be a good choice for Gaming as the performance fluctuates while gaming.
16850,Amazon Customer,5,6,Great laptop at 55K,India,05-Aug-22,Verified Purchase,"I recieved the product which was manafactured and shipped in Jun/22. hence a few surprises contrary to other old reviews.Bought it at 55k during prime day sales.Good things about this device :1. Windows 11 out of the box with almost everything up to date2. MS office 2021 lifetime license3. 512GB(477GB) Samsung(or equivalent) TLC NVme SSD(3500Mbps seq read/writes)4. 8GB DDR4 RAM single channel 3200MHz5. AMD Ryzen 5 5600H (upto 45W TDP)(7nm)6. AMD Radeon RX5500M(4GB) (45-80W TGP)(7nm)7. 4 cell 70Wh battery.8. Great selection of ports (3x USB 3.0,1x USB typeC, 1xHDMI,1x RJ45,1x full size SD card reader, 1x audio jack)9. Screen is definitely big at 16.1 inches10. Feel and finish of the top lid and interior is better than many other laptops (try it out in an offline store first)Compromises you have to make :1. Screen is 60Hz, but an IPS one not a VA panel2. Audio processing and tuning in windows is not natural, the moment you start listening to something, it feels artificial.3. Heavy laptop at 2.6 KG4. Laptop heats when pushed and might even throttle during summers, cooling solution is decent but not extra ordinary.5. Screen wobbling only when directly under a ceiling fan.6. Webcam is average.7. Trackpad is decent(better buy a mouse )8. WiFi card is decent but not the best one.But at 55-60K this laptop justifies its price very well.Update:After adding an additional 16GB DDR4 RAM, the performance is on another level. Games get some extra FPS, more apps remain in memory."

HP has always been against power users. WiFi card don't have good drivers for linux. One plus point is a large trackpad."

16489,Pankaj Mali,4,3,Budget gaming laptop,India,26-Jul-22,Verified Purchase,I am using this laptop since last month. Overall laptop is very good in this budget with high specs. Battery life on normal use will give you 6hrs+ life. But while gaming it will last only 1-2 hour. There is some screen wooble issue. Other everything is perfect in this segment.
20130,Abhishek,5,6,All AMD laptop running amazing with GNU/Linux,India,09-Jul-22,Verified Purchase,"Using for more than 2 months no issue. Currently, I dual boot with OpenSUSE tumbleweed and Windows 11.I really liked the screen even if it's 60Hz but great for me. Great battery life for a gaming laptop about 3-6 hrs normal work like browsing and 8-9+ hrs reading pdf without internet (BTW I play Dota2 ;-) but its always plugged in. Its obvious bcz you are using a gaming beast).Processor is also based on Zen3 architecture with 6 physical cores (12 virtual cores) and it's a desktop grade processor 'H series'.Just one problem if you are using the laptop on unstable surface it wobbles but on a sturdy place it doesn't.Its true it also wobbles with wind so keep it away from direct wind (like fan).I think the thing I need to update is to add RAM (2 same stick bcz I want the benefit of dual channel ;-)IO is also great."

U can go watch some reviews on YouTube, it's not a very big issue but in long run it can become one.I played for 1.5-2 hrs God Of War, then the battery drained, so the battery is actually good. 70Wh is not usual.Hands down to the Bang and Olufsen Audio. Awesome 😎Display is great. Camera is decent.All in all, it's a decent buy. Hope HP fixes the screen wobble issue, then I'll buy it again"
19170,Aravindan,5,5,Perfect budget gaming laptop,India,13-Feb-22,Verified Purchase,"I have purchased this laptop on December 2021. I was in the limited budget of 60k but I liked to buy the 1650 variant but it costs extra 5k... So I bought RX5500M variant and my decision was satisfied. Laptop performance is better. I have completed God of War 2018 PC with this laptop and streamed it on YouTube without any issue. Faced frame drops on some places but that's normal for this budget.Display is only 60Hz, it's a drawback for hardcore gamers. If u have a planning to upgrade it with external monitor, it will not be a issue.Only one negative point I was faced is with Amazon delivery. Even though the product is absolutely fine, the packaging is worst. They haven't even packed, they just sent it with the laptop box by sticking the address itself. There is no extra packing from the vendor side. While I'm unboxing it I found a hole on the pack and shocked but thank god laptop wasn't damaged.I know I can replace it with Amazon policy but still it will take another 7 days to get a new one that will be a disappointment for me. I think it was shipped from Lucknow and delivered in Chennai in a week.I suggest Amazon and vendor to be more careful on packing.Once again thanks for this product Amazon. Because this model is only available on Amazon and I can't any where in offline and online stores."
18621,Mann,5,2,THIS REVIEW IS AFTER 1 MONTH OF USAGE,India,08-May-22,Verified Purchase,"The laptop is nice but dude trust me it is not worthy of paying 60,000, as i have purchased for the same price ,in terms of performs it has a AMD processer hence hats off to the performance . Battery life is also good so far according to my observation ,by just browsing or playing videos on youtube it provided around 6-7 hrs of battery backup ,trust me it is more than enough for a gaming laptop . If you want to purchase for rough use ,you can definitely go for asus tough .THE PROBLEM I FACED WAS ,IT JUST SHUTDOWNS AT AROUND 10%, WHICH I DONT THINK IS NORMAL, SO FAR I THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF HEAVY PROCESSOR OF THE SOO CALLED GAMING LAPTOP. IF YOU EVER VISITED YOUTUBE FOR THE REVIEW OF THIS LAPTOP , THE MENTIONED DISPLAY WOBBLE , YES THEY ARE ABSLOUTLY RIGHT ,EVEN I HAVE FACED THE SAME PROBLEM ,WHICH SHOWS HP POOR QUALITY ,WHICH IS SERIOUSLY NOT EXPECTED , The charger is very fast , It takes just 1/2 hour maximum to charge from 0 to 100 .OVERALL ITS REALLY AWESOME, thankyou"

Great screen - for coding, media consumption gaming although its 60Hz but its good.personally I would prefer choosing 60Hz (compromising battery for Visual pleasing)2. B&o audio settings are also reasonably good.3. keyboard and typing experience is good but i am still getting used to it, I am scared of hitting the powerbutton which is rt above backspace key so I am pretty much scared to use them..(Refer the pic)4. Really liked the trackpad on this device.Super5. it feels fast but yea to write a review about its performance in the very first day is quite independable.6. Havent tested any games, I know it will work most of AAA title games with its full swing, but i am slightly concerned about RX5500m used for constructing machine learning models,..And there are obviously certain applications which has an NVidea autonomy over them.7. Wobbling...its noticable but trust me it ll not intefere with your work...hinge feels safe and 'V' logo is charming.8. its a bit too heavy; like other laptops in this catogory.9. Expandability and upgradability are soothning.10. Battery bakup -dont know🤷‍♂️ but yea 70whr battery could be a thing for you.Mini Omen but Value for money is simply superb.....I wish i get it for 56k....(got it for 60k)i ll surely update about anything else if its concerning."
19144,Gurudatt Shahane,5,One,Good product,India,12-Aug-22,Verified Purchase,Great product with great specs but It's thermal design is not quite good because if I run heavy games processor heats up quickly to very high temperatures. In MSI Bravo 15 with same Ryzen 5600H the cinebench multi-core scores are above 9000 whereas in this laptop it never reaches to 9000 score. So CPU is capable but due to bad thermals performance is constrained.This laptop has good battery that lasts longer than average laptop battery that's a good point.Every laptop have some bad things and this laptop is no different than that.Overall quality is good.

As for gaming, you can get 50 to 70 fps on almost every triple-A game (like Yakuza Like a Dragon and Genshin Impact). As for software, it has both omen gaming hub and AMD software, so very customisable depending on the needs. The Keyboard is perfect, and the build is very sturdy though the screen wobbles sometimes."

U can't find in any laptop in this rangeTwo M.2 slots. Rare feature.RX5500M GPU. Rare GPU in any price. GTX1650 is no match against this monster(in gaming).2 memory slots. No soldered memory.Flicker free display.RAM upgrade supported upto 32GB. Which most Lenovo and Pavillion laptop don't giveCons:Heavy- 2.5KgBuild quality ok, plastic. Not great. Tight hinge. Display wobbles a bit.RX5500M is only good for gaming. Not for machine learning or video rendering.Linux support is really bad. Wifi and GPU driver took real hard work to make it work.

Horrible experience with wifi - can't find my wifi network every other day even though phine next to it can connect with full bars.

Screen wobbles, not much of an issue but it's noticeable sometimes when using on soft surfaces like bed.Battery life is excellent for a gaming laptop. Processor and GPU are the best in price range. Backlit keyboard is nice. Screen is also good. Camera sucks. Speakers have moderate volume. Good amount of ports provided.It is a laptop to be considered by a student with budget 60K as its performance is one of the best in the price range with some compromises which students can easily overlook, also all-day battery life is also something to look for and is rare in gaming laptops."

Also battery backup is extremely good...I am not a gamer but do a lot of hardcore performances like data analysis for research methodology and ran a lot of very heavy softwires.Screen wobbling is not an issue it's depends upon the use of individual perspective....Sound quality is pretty good and loud also.. Typing feedback also good...Everything is perfectly fine.Recommended highly for both professional and gaming purpose.
19860,Shreyas Partake,4,,Great performance but poor display color accuracy and wobbling issue,India,06-Apr-22,,This is a good laptop performancewise. But the screen wobbles a lot when you are under a fan or in front of a cooler. and it takes your attention away from your work to the wobbling issue. Also the display is not at all good. Display colors will be very inaccurate as compared to other laptops. You'll lose the original quality and colors of photos and videos. Please keep in mind these two issues while buying any Victus laptop.

17479,Aditya Gupta,4,2,This is my best decision ever,India,13-Sep-22,,"I had this laptop for 1 month now and I just love it. Initially, when I was going to buy the ""gaming laptop"", I was confused between the MSI GF63 Thin and this one. As you might have guessed, I went for this Victus. Although this has that screen wobbling issue that everyone was complaining in the video, I found it okay. Like it is not evident until and unless you are sitting in front of a fan or A/C.The other thing about this laptop here as it is mentioned here is that this is an all-AMD laptop meaning the processor and the GPU is from AMD and I just love the integration between these two. Agreed that it does give you that ""AMD Advantage"" but this is something I wanted. I use DaVinci Resolve for editing and this actually goes with it quite well, although I can't do the color correction or FX work on this with the 8GB ram that it comes with but it's okay for my use case. Also, the battery backup was good.The only downside of getting this laptop is that it is on the heavier side so if you are the person who wants to get a laptop for the office, this might not be for you. Sharing my personal experience, for these 2 weeks I had pain/cramps in my shoulder and turns out that it is this laptop's fault.To sum it up, if you want to buy a gaming laptop and you are on a budget, then you can consider this one. 😊"

16832,Nafeesa,4,104,"Definitely worth the price, but...",India,09-Oct-21,Verified Purchase,"This is the review of the 16-e0162AX model [ AMD Ryzen 5 with Radeon RX5500M GPU ]The system is exactly the same as the GTX 1650 variant except for the GPU.  In papers Radeon RX5500M is better than GTX 1650.For the first impression, I like the overall design of the laptop.The screen looks fantastic.  One of the major issue highlighted is the refresh rate but I do play games with PS4 connected to my TV / Projector and they are all 60 Hz only and I don't find it really botheringKeyboard is fun to type.  Its backlit but only single color and brightness.  The power button is part of the keyboard layout which requires us to be careful not to press it while trying to use the function keysThe trackpad is one of the best I would say.  While typing this comment, multiple times my palm have pressed the trackpad but it didn't interfered [Awesome].  The tracking was smooth.  When it comes to games, a wired mouse is a must thoughIt right away allowed me to upgrade to Windows 11.  With a few documented changes, it does looks pretty familiar with Windows 10.  I don't see any performance degradation with the upgrade as of now.  Time will tellThe best part is inclusion of Microsoft office 2019 version which is a fully licensed version.  Not many gaming laptop have this and is very usefulThe integrated GPU have 512 MB DDR4 dedicated memory and the dedicated graphics card have 4GB GDDR6 RAM which should be able to handle most of the AAA games.  Will try out few titles and update my review from Gaming perspectiveNow to the not so fun part.As many have pointed out in the review of the GTX 1650, the wobbling of the screen is noticeable but haven't interfered with my usage.  May affect gaming, time will tellThe included 8 GB RAM may not be enough as with nothing additional installed in the machine, currently the memory usage is at 65%.  Good thing is the entire 8 GB is in single slot allowing you to add additional 16 GB RAM in the empty slotThe unknown factsHave read reviews in the GTX 1650 model that the dedicated graphics is used all the time and there's not setting to disable and use the integrated GPU [to save battery while not gaming].  But with this laptop, I am facing the reverse.  My usage of the last 8 hours, only my integrated graphics was used and the dedicated graphics is idle.  I am not sure if it will only be activated while gaming.  Have to check it outThe reduction in 1 star is only related to this GPU issue.  I might update my rating after getting some answersOverall, it's worth the money.  If you want a performance laptop without burning through your savings, you can buy this without a second thought.  If you are a pro gamer, better to go with other brands with RTX 3xxx and above GPU with 144 Hz and above screen refresh rate"
18917,abdulqadir ajabsha,5,68,Best Budget Gaming Laptop,India,11-Oct-21,Verified Purchase,"I purchased it for Coding, Video & Photo Editing and also a bit of gaming. Mostly i multitask a lot using different desktop for all sorts of work and i goes through it smoothly.Display : It is sharp and nice and the viewing angle are also quite good. Brightness level is optimum for indoor use and just fine for outside use. 144hz is missing and can bother few hardcore gamers but i don't mind it being not there.Upgradibility : It has two slots for storage and ram. One slot of each is equipped with 512 samsung nvme ssd and 8gb ram.Storage can be expanded upto 4 tb and ram upto 32 gb ram using both slots.Performance : This laptop is equipped with Ryzen 5 5600h + RX 5500M and performs like a beast so no issue regarding performance. You can throw any game at it and it will do fine.Battery : It works upto 3 hrs on performance mode and upto 6-7 hours on quite mode. I would advice to switch to quite mode if you're performing normal task like typing or web browsing.Build : It is premium plastic and feels great and the finish is also top notch. The screen wobbles but hasn't been an issue to me. It has been just overhyped a bit.Final Conclusion : I bought is for 58k aftee using debit card and it was a great deal for me. It is an all rounder covering everything you expect in a laptop. That's my review as of now. Also it got updated to Windows 11 and works smoothly.Will update if any issue in few weeks or a month."

Either on or off.4.there is no mux switch to switch between dedicated and integrated GPu.

And gpu rx5500m lies between 1660 and 1660 ti.for normal usage temperature is below  55(for coading, browsing, multitasking) but it again depends on surrounding temperature .keyboard and track pad is good.As  utube reviewers said there in no much screen wobble it is fine(until unless u disturb it, it won't wobble. It tried using it under ceiling  fan and it also not wobble even the cpu and gpu fans speed are set to  maximum ,it won't wobble much.). battery backup is not  that much good as  it has 70 whr battery maybe because of large screen.Brightness also fine. Laptop is little bulky.But one thing, I installed nzxt Cam, I don't know why but the curser stopped workingAfter  I opened nzxt Cam .so I uninstalled it, after that I never found that curser issue. (it maybe because of software compatability problem of that software) .Overall performance is good. Good laptop at this price."
19207,Jayant kumar,4,6,Good laptop at Rs. 60000👍😌.,India,24-Nov-21,Verified Purchase,"Let's get to Pros and Cons directly.PROS:-1) It has very good hardware for price (Ryzen 5600h and Radeon Rx 5500m).2) Build quality is good for price. It is plastic.3) It has 2 slots for RAM and NVME m.2 SSD (only 1 of each slot is filled). So room upgrade is there.4) Battery is 76 WattHour. It last for about 7-8 hours on moderate usage. It can be streched to 10 hours on very low usage. No other gaming laptop in same price has similar battery.5) It has Realtek wifi 6 card.6) HP has a guide for teardown of laptop, for replacing parts, etc.7) Keyboard is backlit (not RGB only white). It is full sized( except for function and Arrow keys)8) Trackpad is biggest in this price range (uses synaptic driver).CONS:-1) It has wobble issue. From front it is not negligible, but from side it looks amplified.2) Webcam looks like it hasn't changed from HP pavilion 13 from 2014. It has got an upgrade of increased field of view.3) BIOS looks like it is same in all HP laptop (atleast since 2014).4) No privacy button/cover for webcam.Do not upgrade to Windows 11 (as of 24/11/2021). Wait for atleast 4-5 months before upgrading to it (as from 24/11/2021).Hey if you are willing to buy it , You can. But if you're willing to sacrifice webcam for performance, then go for Asus TUF dash f15 with rtx 3050 or Acer Nitro 5 with 5600h."

It works like a charm and doesn't take too much time to render.I would suggest to go for rx5500m instead of gtx1650 because amd one has more processing sheders(1408) and based on 7nm architecture.Battery consumption is slightly higher than the one which comes with gtx1650.The output of the charger provided with laptop is 150w and the charging speed is pretty fast.U can update the latest drivers from windows updater or hp assistant.The graphic drivers can be update from amd website using radeon pro software.I didn't play any games on this laptop but am pretty sure that it would perform well and will provide u descent fps in most aaa titles.Additional ram and ssd slot is given in this laptop so u can upgrade them in future.Speakers are not loud but the voice is clear. Webcam is average.Overall it's a good laptop under 60k do consider buying it if you are looking for a good laptop with good after sales support and assistance from hp."

I have uploaded the detailed benchmark scores, check that in picture. The laptop is extremely good. Build Quality is just solid, awesome. This laptop has extreme battery & cooling performance. It performs far better than ASUS TUF A15/F15 1650TI Variant. ASUS TUF's cooling is very bad & battery life is 1.5 to 2.5 hours.

Fan speed can also be controlled at OMEN GAMING HUB.• GPU turns of automatically/remains idle if no heavy GPU dependent tasks are running rather i-GPU keeps working for light GPU dependent tasks, this saves battery to a extreme extent.• Budget Friendly• 150W charger/adapter, so charging is extremely fast.• Speakers are also nice and feels good.• Trackpad is also very good, far better than that of other laptops.CONS:• White Backlit Keyboard (single color)• Screen wobbling (this is not a major issue, this can be easily ignored, stable until forced vibrations are produced)• 60Hz Display refresh rate.• Weight 2.4 KGsGames I have played on this:Red Dead Redemption 2 - High Graphics (8GB RAM), Ultra graphics (16GB RAM) - 55fps min 60 fps maxWatch Dogs 2 - Ultra graphics 52fps min 60fps maxCall of Duty WWII - High Graphics (8GB RAM), Ultra (16GB) 45fps min 60fps maxMicrosoft Flight simulator 2020 - Medium Graphics (8GB RAM), Ultra (16GB) - 48fps min 60fps maxTrain Sim World 2 - Ultra Graphics (16GB) - 40fps min 60fps max."
